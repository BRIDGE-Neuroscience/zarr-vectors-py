# How to cite

## zarr-vectors-py

If you use `zarr-vectors-py` in research that leads to a publication,
please cite the software repository:

```bibtex
@software{zarr_vectors_py,
  author       = {{BRIDGE Neuroscience}},
  title        = {{zarr-vectors-py: Python tools for the Zarr Vector Format}},
  year         = {2024},
  publisher    = {GitHub},
  url          = {https://github.com/BRIDGE-Neuroscience/zarr-vectors-py},
  note         = {Aligned to the Zarr Vectors specification by Forest Collman,
                  Allen Institute for Brain Sciences.
                  \url{https://github.com/AllenInstitute/zarr_vectors}}
}
```

## The Zarr Vector Format specification

The ZVF format was originally specified by Forest Collman at the Allen
Institute for Brain Sciences. Please also cite the upstream specification:

```bibtex
@misc{collman_zarr_vectors,
  author       = {Collman, Forest},
  title        = {{Zarr Vectors: a cloud-native format for spatial vector data}},
  year         = {2023},
  publisher    = {GitHub},
  url          = {https://github.com/AllenInstitute/zarr_vectors}
}
```

## zv-ngtools

If you use the Neuroglancer integration (`zv-ngtools`) in your work:

```bibtex
@software{zv_ngtools,
  author       = {{BRIDGE Neuroscience}},
  title        = {{zv-ngtools: Neuroglancer integration for zarr-vectors}},
  year         = {2024},
  publisher    = {GitHub},
  url          = {https://github.com/BRIDGE-Neuroscience/zv-ngtools},
  note         = {Fork of ngtools by Yael Balbastre (neuroscales/ngtools).
                  \url{https://github.com/neuroscales/ngtools}}
}
```

## Dependency citations
