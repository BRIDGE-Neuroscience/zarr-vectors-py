# ZVF and OME-Zarr

## Terms

**OME-Zarr (NGFF)**
: Open Microscopy Environment Next-Generation File Format — a Zarr v2/v3
  based format for bioimaging data, primarily volumetric fluorescence and
  electron microscopy images. Defined at https://ngff.openmicroscopy.org.

**`multiscales` block**
: A JSON array in a Zarr group's `.zattrs` that declares a multi-resolution
  image pyramid, with one entry per resolution level. Shared between OME-Zarr
  and ZVF.

**`coordinateTransformations`**
: Per-level or per-dataset affine transformations declared within a
  `multiscales` entry. Used by OME-Zarr-aware tools to map between pixel
  space and physical space.

**OME-Zarr axes**
: An array of axis descriptor objects (name, type, unit) that declares
  the semantic meaning and physical units of each array dimension. Present
  in the `multiscales` block.

**NGFF label**
: An OME-Zarr sub-format for integer segmentation label images stored as a
  multi-resolution Zarr array. Commonly used for cell or nucleus
  segmentation masks.

## Introduction

ZVF and OME-Zarr target different data types (sparse vector geometry vs
dense image volumes) but share a common metadata convention: the
`multiscales` JSON block. ZVF borrows this block from OME-Zarr 0.5,
extending it with vector-geometry-specific keys (`bin_ratio`, `bin_shape`,
`object_sparsity`) while preserving full compatibility with the OME-Zarr
schema as seen by tools that do not understand the extensions.

This shared metadata convention makes ZVF stores partially visible to
OME-Zarr-aware tools, enables joint discovery with image data registered
in the same coordinate space, and positions ZVF as a complement to OME-Zarr
in multi-modal bioimaging workflows.

## Technical reference

### What ZVF borrows from OME-Zarr

| OME-Zarr feature | ZVF adoption | Notes |
|-----------------|-------------|-------|
| `multiscales` block structure | Adopted verbatim | `version`, `name`, `axes`, `datasets`, `coordinateTransformations` |
| `axes` array (name, type, unit) | Adopted | ZVF axis order follows OME-Zarr convention (slowest to fastest) |
| `coordinateTransformations` | Adopted | `scale` and `translation` transforms per level |
| OME-Zarr `version` field | Adopted | Value `"0.5"` |

### What ZVF adds to the `multiscales` block

ZVF adds the following keys to `multiscales` that are not part of the
OME-Zarr spec. OME-Zarr-aware tools will ignore these unknown keys:

| Key | Level | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| `type: "zarr_vectors_multiscale"` | Top-level | Identifies this as a ZVF multiscales block |
| `datasets[].bin_ratio` | Per-level | Vector binning ratio (ZVF-specific) |
| `datasets[].bin_shape` | Per-level | Effective bin shape (redundant but explicit) |
| `datasets[].object_sparsity` | Per-level | Object thinning fraction |

### Coordinate transforms: ZVF encoding

ZVF uses `scale` and `translation` to encode the physical meaning of coarser
resolution metanodes. For a level with `bin_ratio = [r_0, r_1, r_2]` and
`bin_shape = [b_0, b_1, b_2]`:

```json
"coordinateTransformations": [
  {"type": "scale",       "scale":       [r_0, r_1, r_2]},
  {"type": "translation", "translation": [b_0/2, b_1/2, b_2/2]}
]
```

**Scale** encodes the bin ratio: a coarser-level metanode position must be
multiplied by `r_d` to recover physical position. This matches the OME-Zarr
convention for image downscaling, where `scale[d] = downscale_factor[d]`.

**Translation** encodes the centroid offset: metanodes are positioned at
bin centroids, so they are offset by half a bin width from the bin origin.
OME-Zarr uses `translation` for the same purpose in image pyramids (the
centre of a downscaled pixel is offset from the corner).

This encoding means that an OME-Zarr-aware viewer correctly positions ZVF
metanodes in physical space using the standard `scale → translate` pipeline,
without any ZVF-specific code.

### What OME-Zarr tools see when opening a ZVF store

An OME-Zarr reader (e.g. `ome-zarr-py`, napari with `napari-ome-zarr`,
`zarr-viewer`) opening a ZVF store will:

1. Find a valid `multiscales` block in `.zattrs`. ✓
2. Read `axes`, `datasets`, and `coordinateTransformations`. ✓
3. Ignore `type: "zarr_vectors_multiscale"` (unknown type, skipped). ✓
4. Attempt to open `resolution_0/vertices/` as an image array.
   - The array is `(Cx, Cy, Cz, N_max, D)` float32 — 5-D.
   - Most image viewers expect 2–4-D arrays. The viewer may reject the
     array or display it as a meaningless 5-D volume. ✗

The practical result: OME-Zarr metadata tools (validators, metadata
registries, data portals) can index and discover ZVF stores. Interactive
image viewers will not render the data usefully but will not crash on the
metadata.

### What ZVF does not borrow from OME-Zarr

**Image arrays.** OME-Zarr image arrays are dense (C × Z × Y × X) arrays
where every pixel has a value. ZVF vertex arrays are ragged (one array per
chunk, variable number of vertices). There is no compatibility at the array
data level.

**Label format.** OME-Zarr labels (segmentation masks) are stored as
integer image arrays with OME-Zarr conventions. ZVF does not adopt this
convention; semantic labels in ZVF are stored as per-vertex or per-object
attributes.

**Plate/Well convention.** OME-Zarr has HCS (High Content Screening)
conventions for plate/well/field data. ZVF has no equivalent.

### Using ZVF alongside OME-Zarr image data

A common workflow in connectomics and neuroscience registers ZVF vector
data against an OME-Zarr image volume in the same physical coordinate space:

```
experiment/
├── image.zarr/               ← OME-Zarr image (EM, light microscopy)
│   ├── .zattrs               ← multiscales with spatial calibration
│   └── 0/ 1/ 2/              ← resolution levels
└── tracts.zarrvectors/       ← ZVF streamlines in the same RAS space
    ├── .zattrs               ← multiscales with matching axes/units
    └── resolution_0/ 1/
```

Both stores declare `"axes": [{"name": "z", "unit": "micrometer"}, …]`.
A viewer that understands both formats (such as Neuroglancer via
`zv-ngtools`) can overlay them in physical space using the coordinate
transforms from each store's `multiscales` block.

### OME-Zarr compatibility checklist

To maximise compatibility of a ZVF store with OME-Zarr tools:

- [ ] Include `multiscales` block with `version: "0.5"`.
- [ ] Include `axes` with `name`, `type`, and `unit` for all D axes.
- [ ] Ensure `coordinateTransformations` has exactly one `scale` and one
      `translation` per level, in that order.
- [ ] Set `axis_units` in root `.zattrs` consistently with the `axes` unit
      declarations.
- [ ] Run `zarr.consolidate_metadata(store)` after writing for fast
      metadata discovery.

Stores passing these checks will be correctly indexed by OME-Zarr metadata
tools and will display correct physical coordinates in viewers that read
the transforms.
