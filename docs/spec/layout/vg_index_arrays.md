# Fragment-index arrays

```{admonition} Format change in ZVF 0.6.0
:class: note

Prior to ZVF 0.6.0 the per-chunk spatial index was a fixed-shape
`int64` array named `vertex_group_offsets/<i.j.k>` storing one
`(offset, count)` row per bin. ZVF 0.6.0 replaced it with the
binary **fragment-index** format described on this page. The
semantic role is the same — locating vertices within a chunk —
but the new format adds two capabilities: *explicit* (non-contiguous)
fragments, and *fragment sharing* across object manifests at
coarsened pyramid levels.

0.5.x stores are not readable by 0.6+ readers; rewrite from source.
```

## Terms

**Fragment**
: A logical grouping of rows inside one chunk's `vertices/<i.j.k>`
  (or `links/0/<i.j.k>`) array. A fragment is either a contiguous
  range of rows or an explicit list of row indices. At level 0 with
  the default writer, each non-empty bin emits exactly one fragment;
  at coarsened pyramid levels a fragment may represent a metavertex
  shared between several objects' manifests.

**Range fragment**
: A fragment that owns a contiguous run `[start, start + count)` of
  row indices into the chunk's payload array. The historical analogue
  of a pre-0.6 `(offset, count)` row.

**Explicit fragment**
: A fragment that owns an arbitrary, non-contiguous list of row
  indices. Enables a single chunk row to participate in more than
  one fragment — the primitive behind shared metavertices at
  coarsened levels.

**Fragment index** (the array `vertex_fragments/<i.j.k>`)
: The binary blob inside one chunk that describes the F fragments
  in that chunk. Encoded in the v1 layout described below
  (magic `'ZVFG'` = `0x5A56_4647`).

**Range bitmap**
: A bitmap of length F (padded to bytes) inside the fragment index,
  where bit `f` is set iff fragment `f` is a range. Lets readers
  classify a fragment in one bit lookup.

**Range table**
: The packed array of `(start, count)` int64 pairs, one row per
  range fragment, stored in fragment-index order.

**CSR (explicit)**
: The compressed-sparse-row layout used for explicit fragments:
  a `uint32 offsets[E+1]` array of running offsets, plus a flat
  `int64 indices[T]` array of concatenated row indices.

**Shared fragment**
: A fragment named by more than one object's manifest. Stored once;
  vertex rows are not duplicated. Marked at the level via
  `LevelMetadata.shared_fragments=True` and at the store via the
  `CAP_SHARED_FRAGMENTS` capability token.

**Vertex group (VG)**
: The *conceptual* unit "all vertices in one bin in one chunk".
  See [Vertex groups and fragments](../object_model/vertex_groups.md).
  At level 0 with the default writer, one non-empty VG ↔ one
  range fragment. At coarsened levels the VG/bin model is supplanted
  by the fragment as the addressing primitive.

### What happened to `offset` and `count`?

| Pre-0.6 | Post-0.6 |
|---------|----------|
| `vertex_group_offsets[chunk][b, 0]` (offset) | `range_table[r, 0]` (start) for the range fragment that represents bin `b` |
| `vertex_group_offsets[chunk][b, 1]` (count) | `range_table[r, 1]` (count) |
| `count == 0` (empty bin) | No fragment is emitted for that bin |
| `count == -1` (fill, never written) | No fragment is emitted for that bin |

In the new format, empty bins do not occupy a slot; the fixed
`B_per_chunk × 16-byte` overhead of the pre-0.6 layout is gone.
Variable-width fragments and arbitrary index lists become possible
because the index no longer relies on a fixed-shape int64 table.

## Introduction

The fragment index is the per-chunk spatial acceleration structure
of ZVF. Without it, a bounding-box query would have to load every
chunk's full vertex payload and filter client-side. With it, readers
load only the byte ranges that overlap the query.

The format was rewritten in ZVF 0.6.0 for two reasons:

1. **Shared metavertices at coarsened levels.** When the pyramid
   builder coarsens N objects whose paths share a metavertex, the
   pre-0.6 design forced the metavertex's vertex row to be duplicated
   per object. The new format lets each object's manifest *name* the
   same fragment in the same chunk; the underlying vertex row is
   stored once.

2. **Eliminate fixed empty-bin overhead.** The pre-0.6
   `vertex_group_offsets/` array stored a `(0, 0)` or `(-1, -1)`
   row for every bin in every chunk — even bins that never held a
   vertex. For sparse stores this dominated index size. The new
   format stores only as many fragments as the chunk needs.

Trade-off: parsing a fragment index requires a tiny decoder
(presented below) instead of a single `int64` Zarr array read.
Decode cost is dominated by a one-time O(F) prefix-popcount built
lazily on first access; subsequent lookups are O(1).

This page describes the byte layout, the decoder algorithm, and the
read path that resolves an object's manifest down to vertex rows.
See [`zarr_vectors.encoding.fragments`](../../api/index.rst) for the
reference implementation.

## Technical reference

### On-disk byte layout (v1)

```
HEADER (16 bytes)
  uint32 magic            = 0x5A56_4647  ('ZVFG')
  uint16 version          = 1
  uint16 flags            = 0            (reserved)
  uint32 num_fragments      F
  uint32 num_range_fragments R           (popcount of bitmap; redundant)

RANGE BITMAP
  ceil(F/8) bytes, padded to next 8-byte boundary
  bit f (LSB-first within byte f >> 3) = 1 iff fragment f is a range

RANGE TABLE
  R entries × 16 bytes
  int64 start, int64 count   per range fragment, in fragment-index order

EXPLICIT CSR (E = F − R)
  uint32 explicit_offsets[E+1]   running offsets into explicit_indices
  int64  explicit_indices[T]     concatenated indices, T = explicit_offsets[E]
```

An empty chunk (no fragments) is a 16-byte header-only blob with
`F = 0`, `R = 0`, no bitmap, no range table, no CSR.

### Header

The 16-byte header is the struct `<IHHII` (little-endian: `uint32`,
`uint16`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint32`). It is sized so that the
subsequent range table (`int64` rows) is naturally 8-byte-aligned —
the alignment also drives the bitmap-padding rule below.

Invariant: `num_range_fragments == popcount(range_bitmap[0:F])`.
Readers SHOULD validate this; the reference decoder raises on
mismatch.

### Range bitmap

`ceil(F/8)` raw bytes, then zero-padded to the next 8-byte boundary
so the following range table starts on an `int64`-aligned offset.
Bits are LSB-first within each byte:

```python
is_range_f = (bitmap[f >> 3] >> (f & 7)) & 1
```

Padding bytes are zero on write; decoders MUST ignore them.

### Range table

`R` rows of 16 bytes each: `int64 start`, `int64 count`.

```{important}
**Row order matters.** Row `r` corresponds to the `r`-th *set bit*
of the bitmap when scanned from `f = 0` upward — **not** to the
`f`-th fragment. A naive reader that indexes `range_table[f]`
will get the wrong row whenever any earlier fragment is explicit.
The reference decoder uses a prefix-popcount of the bitmap to map
`f → r` in O(1); see the decoder algorithm below.
```

`start` is the row index in `vertices/<chunk_coords>` of the first
row of the fragment; `count` is the number of rows.

### Explicit CSR

For the `E = F − R` explicit fragments, indices are stored CSR-style:

- `uint32 explicit_offsets[E+1]` — running offsets. Strictly
  monotone non-decreasing. `explicit_offsets[0] == 0`.
- `int64 explicit_indices[T]` — flat array of length
  `T = explicit_offsets[E]`. The indices of explicit fragment with
  *explicit-index* `e` (its position among explicit fragments, not
  among all fragments) are `explicit_indices[offsets[e] : offsets[e+1]]`.

Indices are **absolute row indices** into `vertices/<chunk_coords>`,
not deltas, not bin-relative offsets. Indices MUST be non-negative
and SHOULD lie in `[0, len(vertices[chunk]))`.

A zero-length explicit fragment is legal (`offsets[e+1] == offsets[e]`)
and is the way to round-trip an empty fragment that the writer wanted
to keep distinguishable from an empty range.

### Decoder algorithm

The reference `FragmentIndex` class holds zero-copy views over the
underlying bytes plus a lazy prefix-popcount cache. The cache is
the only non-obvious piece:

```python
def _popcount_prefix(bitmap, F):
    """O(F) prefix-popcount of the bitmap.
    prefix[i] = number of range fragments in [0, i).
    """
    bits   = np.unpackbits(bitmap, bitorder="little")[:F].astype(np.int32)
    prefix = np.empty(F + 1, dtype=np.int32)
    prefix[0] = 0
    np.cumsum(bits, out=prefix[1:])
    return prefix
```

Built once on first access; subsequent fragment lookups are O(1):

```python
def is_range(f):
    return (bitmap[f >> 3] >> (f & 7)) & 1

def range(f):                            # range fragment f → (start, count)
    r = prefix[f]                        # row in range_table
    return range_table[r, 0], range_table[r, 1]

def indices(f):                          # any fragment f → row indices
    if is_range(f):
        s, c = range(f)
        return np.arange(s, s + c)
    e = f - prefix[f]                    # explicit-index of f
    a, b = csr_offsets[e], csr_offsets[e + 1]
    return csr_indices[a:b]
```

`is_range(f)` is a single bit lookup and does not warm the cache.
`range(f)` and `indices(f)` warm it on first call.

### Query path: manifest → fragments → vertex rows

To read all vertices belonging to one object:

1. Decode the object's **manifest** from `object_index/data` — a
   sequence of per-chunk blocks, each naming `(chunk_coords,
   fragment_ref)` where `fragment_ref` is one of the three manifest
   block modes (single / range / explicit). See
   [Object manifest](../object_model/object_manifest.md) for the
   manifest blob format.

2. For each block, load the chunk's `vertex_fragments/<chunk_coords>`
   blob and `decode_fragments` it.

3. Resolve `fragment_ref` to a set of fragment indices `f`:
   - mode 0 (single): `[fragment_ref]`
   - mode 1 (range): `range(start, start + count)`
   - mode 2 (explicit): the stored `int64` list

4. For each `f`, compute the row indices via `fidx.indices(f)`.

5. Read `vertices/<chunk_coords>[rows, :]` and concatenate across
   blocks in manifest order.

### Bounding-box query path

For spatial (bbox) queries rather than per-object reads:

**Level 0, default writer.** Each non-empty bin has emitted exactly
one range fragment. The bbox query is:

```python
for chunk_coord in overlapping_chunks(bbox):
    fidx = read_fragment_index(VERTEX_FRAGMENTS, chunk_coord)
    for f in range(fidx.num_fragments):
        start, count = fidx.range(f)
        # Optional bin-bbox prefilter: the writer's fragment-order
        # invariant lets readers map f → bin and skip bin bboxes
        # outside the query without reading vertex rows.
        verts = vertices[chunk_coord][start : start + count]
        yield verts  # final point-in-bbox filter applied client-side
```

**Coarsened levels with `shared_fragments=True`.** The query walks
every fragment in overlapping chunks; sharing is invisible to the
spatial read path. A range fragment whose `count` covers a
post-coarsening metavertex still resolves to one contiguous row
slice. An explicit fragment's row list materialises via
`fidx.indices(f)` and gather-loads from `vertices/<chunk_coord>`.

### `vertex_fragments/` array schema

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| zarr `node_type` | `array` |
| dtype | `uint8` |
| logical shape | one variable-length blob per chunk, addressed by chunk coordinate |
| codec pipeline | none — chunks are written as opaque bytes via the FsGroup `write_bytes` path |
| group metadata | `{"zv_array": "vertex_fragments", "encoding": "fragment_index_v1"}` |

Each chunk holds one fragment-index blob in the v1 byte layout
described above. The metadata `encoding: "fragment_index_v1"` tag
identifies the format and is the discriminator that future versions
of ZVF will rev when the binary layout changes.

The blob is intentionally not compressed by default. It is already
binary-packed (header + bitmap + dense int64 range table + uint32/int64
CSR), and general-purpose compression typically adds latency to hot
decode paths without meaningful ratio gain. Stores that must minimise
on-disk size MAY wrap chunk writes in their own compression layer; the
fragment-index format is independent of any outer compression.

### `link_fragments/` array schema

Identical structure, parallel role for the cross-chunk link arrays
at `delta == 0`:

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| zarr `node_type` | `array` |
| dtype | `uint8` |
| logical shape | one blob per chunk |
| codec pipeline | none |
| group metadata | `{"zv_array": "link_fragments", "encoding": "fragment_index_v1"}` |

`link_fragments/<chunk_coords>` describes the fragment partition of
`links/0/<chunk_coords>` rows. Present iff the geometry type has
connectivity (polyline / streamline / graph / skeleton / mesh) and
at least one chunk has been written. Cross-level link arrays
(`delta != 0`) keep their inline self-describing header and do not
have a `link_fragments/` sibling.

### Write-time invariants

A writer SHALL maintain:

1. **Magic and version.** Every blob begins with `'ZVFG'`
   (`0x5A56_4647`) followed by `version = 1`.
2. **Popcount agreement.** The header's `num_range_fragments` equals
   the popcount of the range bitmap over the first `F` bits.
3. **Bitmap padding.** Bytes beyond `ceil(F/8)` in the range bitmap
   region are zero.
4. **Range table order.** Row `r` of the range table corresponds to
   the `r`-th set bit of the bitmap (scan order `f = 0, 1, …`).
5. **CSR monotonicity.** `explicit_offsets[0] == 0` and
   `explicit_offsets[i+1] >= explicit_offsets[i]`.
6. **Index bounds.** Range fragments' `[start, start + count)` and
   explicit fragments' indices lie in `[0, len(vertices[chunk_coords]))`.
7. **Non-negative explicit indices.** Every entry of
   `explicit_indices` is `>= 0`.

At level 0, the default writer additionally emits one range fragment
per non-empty bin in ascending bin-flat-index order, preserving the
pre-0.6 VG order convention. At coarsened levels, fragment order
follows the metavertex emission order chosen by the coarsening
pipeline.

### Worked example

A chunk holds three fragments:

- **Fragment 0** is a range starting at row 0, count 4 — the
  vertices of one non-empty bin at level 0.
- **Fragment 1** is explicit, with rows `[12, 7, 19]` — a shared
  metavertex emitted by the coarsening pipeline that references
  rows of `vertices/<chunk>` not contiguous in bin order.
- **Fragment 2** is a range starting at row 20, count 8 — another
  non-empty bin at level 0.

So `F = 3`, `R = 2`, `E = 1`, `T = 3`. Annotated hex dump:

```

Total blob size: 88 bytes.

Walking through `fidx.indices(1)`:

1. `is_range(1)` reads bit 1 of byte 0 of the bitmap: `0x05 >> 1 & 1
   = 0` → explicit.
2. The lazy prefix-popcount yields `prefix = [0, 1, 1, 2]`.
3. `e = 1 - prefix[1] = 1 - 1 = 0` — fragment 1 is the *zeroth*
   explicit fragment.
4. `a, b = csr_offsets[0], csr_offsets[1] = 0, 3`.
5. Return `csr_indices[0:3] = [12, 7, 19]`. Done.
