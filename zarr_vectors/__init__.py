# Version resolution.  Three sources in priority order:
#   1. ``zarr_vectors/_version.py`` — written by setuptools-scm at build
#      time from the git tag (e.g. ``v0.1.0`` → ``0.1.0``).  Present in
#      wheels and in any checkout that has been ``pip install -e``'d.
#   2. ``importlib.metadata`` — the version recorded in the installed
#      package's metadata; covers the case where _version.py is absent
#      but the package is installed.
#   3. ``"0.0.0+unknown"`` — running from a raw source checkout that
#      has never been built or installed.  Tools that key on version
#      should treat this as a sentinel.
