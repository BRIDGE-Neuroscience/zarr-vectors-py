"""Post-edit cleanup passes.

Atomic edits accumulate dead weight:

- **Sparse OIDs**: every atomic edit appends a new OID; old ones are
  left as empty manifests scattered between live entries.
- **Empty fragments**: ``remove_fragment(atomic=True)`` empties a
  fragment's row list but keeps the index slot.
- **Parallel rows** after chunk-cross + keep-source: the same logical
  vertex exists in both the source and target chunk for different OID
  populations.

``vacuum(root, ...)`` reclaims this dead weight.  This iteration
implements **OID compaction only**; the other two passes are stubbed
out so the public API stays stable for when they land later.

OID compaction:

1. Read every manifest at every level (via ``read_all_object_manifests``).
2. Identify OIDs with non-empty manifests; these are the "live" OIDs.
3. Build a dense remap ``{old_oid: new_oid}`` so live OIDs occupy
   ``[0, n_live)`` in their original relative order.
4. Rewrite ``object_index/manifests`` at ``total_objects=n_live``.
5. For every present ``object_attributes/<name>/`` array, reorder rows
   by the remap (dropping orphan rows) and write back.

Returns a :class:`VacuumReport`.  External consumers that hold OIDs
must compose them through ``oid_remap`` to stay valid.
